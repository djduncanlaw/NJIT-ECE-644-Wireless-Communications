%% COST 207 Channel Models: Overview
% The COST 207 channel models [1] for mobile radio were standardized to
% enable different communications designers to simulate their systems using
% a common set of channel models.  Four propagation models are defined:
% rural area (RA), typical urban area (TU), bad urban area (BU), and hilly
% terrain (HT).  The RA case comprises two distinct channel models, while
% the other cases each comprise four channel models, for a total of 14
% channel models.
%
% Each channel model has several taps.  Each tap is characterized by a
% relative delay (with respect to the first path delay), a relative power,
% and a Doppler spectrum category.  The possible Doppler categories are
% CLASS, RICE, GAUS1, and GAUS2.  The CLASS Doppler category refers to the
% "classical" spectrum, which is also often termed the Jakes spectrum.  The
% RICE Doppler spectrum is equivalent to the CLASS Doppler spectrum, but
% with an impulse at the frequency corresponding to the Doppler shift of
% the line-of-sight component.  The GAUS1 and GAUS2 Doppler categories are
% special cases of the bi-Gaussian spectrum, i.e. the sum of two Gaussian
% functions in frequency.

%% COST 207 Channel Simulation: Methodology
% We review the methodology to simulate a given COST 207 channel model.  At
% first, Doppler spectrum objects relevant to the given COST 207 model are
% constructed.  Then, a Rayleigh or Rician multipath fading channel object
% is constructed, and its properties initialized to produce the desired
% channel model.  Data is then processed by the channel object, in order to
% visualize some properties of the channel using the channel visualization
% tool.

%% Initialization of Simulation-Specific Parameters 
% The simulation sampling rate and the maximum Doppler shift are specified,
% and kept the same for the remainder of the example.  The input to the
% channel simulator is oversampled by a factor of four.

M = 8;                      % Modulation order

psk8Mod = comm.PSKModulator(M, 'PhaseOffset', 0); % PSK Modulator System object

Rsym = 100000;                % Input symbol rate
Rbit = Rsym * log2(M);      % Input bit rate
Nos = 4;                    % Oversampling factor
ts = (1/Rbit) / Nos;        % Input sample period

v = 120 * 1e3/3600;         % Mobile speed (m/s)
fc = 1800e6;                % Carrier frequency
c = 3e8;                    % Speed of light in free space
fd = v*fc/c;                % Maximum Doppler shift of diffuse component

%% Construction of Doppler Objects
% We construct Doppler objects that will be used by the channel objects to
% produce the desired Doppler spectrum category.  These Doppler objects are
% part of the Doppler package of Communications System Toolbox.  Type |help
% doppler| for information about the Doppler package, and |help
% doppler/types| to get the list of supported Doppler spectrum types.
% 
% The command below constructs a Doppler object of type Jakes, which is
% used to emulate the CLASS Doppler category.

dopjakes = doppler.jakes

%%
% The following lines instantiate and initialize a bi-Gaussian Doppler
% object with parameters corresponding to that of the GAUS1 Doppler
% category.

dopgauss1 = doppler.bigaussian;
dopgauss1.CenterFreqGaussian1 = -0.8;
dopgauss1.CenterFreqGaussian2 = 0.4;
dopgauss1.SigmaGaussian1 = 0.05;
dopgauss1.SigmaGaussian2 = 0.1;
dopgauss1.GainGaussian1 = sqrt(2*pi*(dopgauss1.SigmaGaussian1)^2);
dopgauss1.GainGaussian2 = 1/10 * sqrt(2*pi*(dopgauss1.SigmaGaussian2)^2)

%% 
% Similarly, a bi-Gaussian Doppler object with parameters corresponding to
% that of the GAUS2 model is constructed below.

dopgauss2 = doppler.bigaussian;
dopgauss2.CenterFreqGaussian1 = 0.7;
dopgauss2.CenterFreqGaussian2 = -0.4;
dopgauss2.SigmaGaussian1 = 0.1;
dopgauss2.SigmaGaussian2 = 0.15;
dopgauss2.GainGaussian1 = sqrt(2*pi*(dopgauss1.SigmaGaussian1)^2);
dopgauss2.GainGaussian2 = 1/10^1.5 * sqrt(2*pi*(dopgauss1.SigmaGaussian2)^2)

%% RAx4 Channel Model: Rural Area with 4 Taps
% The rural area (RA) models are characterized by Rician fading on the
% first path, and Rayleigh fading on the remaining paths.  The first path
% has a RICE Doppler spectrum, while the remaining paths have a CLASS
% Doppler spectrum.  The line-of-sight component of the first path has a
% Doppler shift of 0.7 times the maximum Doppler shift of the diffuse
% component.
%
% The code below constructs a Rician channel object according to the RA
% model with 4 taps.  By default, a Rician channel object has a RICE (Jakes
% + impulse) spectrum on the first path, and a CLASS (Jakes) spectrum on
% subsequent paths.

kFactor = 0.87/0.13;    % Note: we use the value from 3GPP TS 45.005 V7.9.0
fdLOS = 0.7 * fd;
RAx4PathDelays = [0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6] * 1e-6;
RAx4AvgPathGaindB = [0 -2 -10 -20];

chan = ricianchan(ts, fd, kFactor, RAx4PathDelays, RAx4AvgPathGaindB, fdLOS)

%%
% The code below simulates the RAx4 channel and visualizes the Doppler
% spectrum of the first path using the channel visualization tool.

% This setting is needed to store quantities used by the channel
% visualization tool.
chan.StoreHistory = 1;
% After each frame is processed, the channel is not reset: this is 
% necessary to preserve continuity across frames.
chan.ResetBeforeFiltering = 0;
% This setting makes the total average power of all path gains be
% equal to 1.
chan.NormalizePathGains = 1;

Nframes = 12;
Nsamples = 1e4;
for iFrames = 1:Nframes
    y = filter(chan, psk8Mod(randi([0 M-1],Nsamples,1)));
    plot(chan);
    % Select the Doppler spectrum as the current visualization.
    if iFrames == 1, channel_vis(chan, 'visualization', 'doppler'); end;
end

%% 
% We then visualize the scattering function.

channel_vis(chan, 'visualization', 'scattering');

Nframes = 6;
for iFrames = 1:Nframes
    y = filter(chan, psk8Mod(randi([0 M-1],Nsamples,1)));
    plot(chan);
end


%% BUx6 Channel Model: Bad Urban with 6 Taps
% The bad urban (BU) models are characterized by Rayleigh fading on all
% paths.  In the case of the BU channels with 6 taps, the first two paths
% have a CLASS (Jakes) Doppler spectrum, the next two paths have a GAUS1
% Doppler spectrum, and the remaining two paths a GAUS2 Doppler spectrum.
%
% The code below constructs a Rayleigh channel object according to the BU
% model with 6 taps.  It uses the Doppler objects created earlier to
% specify the |DopplerSpectrum| property of the constructed channel object.

channel_vis(chan, 'close');

chan = rayleighchan(ts, fd);

% Assign profile-specific properties to channel object.
chan.PathDelays = [0.0 0.4 1.0 1.6 5.0 6.6] * 1e-6;
chan.AvgPathGaindB = [-3 0 -3 -5 -2 0];
chan.DopplerSpectrum = [dopjakes dopjakes dopgauss1 dopgauss1 dopgauss2 dopgauss2]


%%
% The code below simulates the BUx6 channel and visualizes the Doppler
% spectrum of the third path using the channel visualization tool.

chan.StoreHistory = 1;
chan.ResetBeforeFiltering = 0;
chan.NormalizePathGains = 1;

Nframes = 12;
for iFrames = 1:Nframes
    y = filter(chan, psk8Mod(randi([0 M-1],Nsamples,1)));
    plot(chan);
    % Select the Doppler spectrum of the third path as the
    % current visualization.
    if iFrames == 1, channel_vis(chan, 'visualization', 'doppler', 3); end;
end

%% 
% We then visualize the scattering function.

channel_vis(chan, 'visualization', 'scattering');

Nframes = 6;
for iFrames = 1:Nframes
    y = filter(chan, psk8Mod(randi([0 M-1],Nsamples,1)));
    plot(chan);
end


%% HTx12 Channel Model: Hilly Terrain with 12 Taps
% The hilly terrain (HT) models are also characterized by Rayleigh fading
% on all paths.  The HT channels with 12 taps have a mixture of CLASS,
% GAUS1, and GAUS2 taps.
%
% We use the function |stdchan| to construct a channel object according to
% the HT model with 12 taps.  For a list of standardized channel models
% supported by |stdchan|, type |help stdchan|.

channel_vis(chan, 'close');

chan = stdchan(ts, fd, 'cost207HTx12')

%% 
% We bring up the channel visualization tool and visualize the scattering
% function.

chan.StoreHistory = 1;
chan.ResetBeforeFiltering = 0;
chan.NormalizePathGains = 1;

Nframes = 6;
for iFrames = 1:Nframes
    y = filter(chan, psk8Mod(randi([0 M-1],Nsamples,1)));
    plot(chan);
    if iFrames == 1, channel_vis(chan, 'visualization', 'scattering'); end;
end

%% GSM/EDGE Channel Models
% The |stdchan| function also provides support for GSM/EDGE channel models
% [2], [3], among other standardized models.  Several GSM/EDGE channel
% models are based on the COST 207 channel models, but with the assumption
% that each Rayleigh-fading tap has a Jakes Doppler spectrum.
%
% Below we construct a channel object according to the Profile for
% equalization test, i.e. EQx [2], [3], and visualize its scattering
% function.

channel_vis(chan, 'close');

chan = stdchan(ts, fd, 'gsmEQx6');

chan.StoreHistory = 1;
chan.ResetBeforeFiltering = 0;
chan.NormalizePathGains = 1;

Nframes = 6;
for iFrames = 1:Nframes
    y = filter(chan, psk8Mod(randi([0 M-1],Nsamples,1)));
    plot(chan);
    if iFrames == 1, channel_vis(chan, 'visualization', 'scattering'); end;
