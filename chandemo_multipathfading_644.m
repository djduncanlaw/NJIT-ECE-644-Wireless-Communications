%% Multipath Fading Channel
% This example shows how to use Rayleigh and Rician multipath fading
% channel System objects and their built-in visualization to model a fading
% channel. Rayleigh and Rician fading channels are useful models of
% real-world phenomena in wireless communication. These phenomena include
% multipath scattering effects, time dispersion, and Doppler shifts that
% arise from relative motion between the transmitter and receiver.
%
% Processing a signal using a fading channel involves the following steps:
%
% # Create a channel System object that describes the channel that you want
%    to use. A channel object is a type of MATLAB(R) variable that contains
%    information about the channel, such as the maximum Doppler shift.
% # Adjust properties of the System object, if necessary, to tailor it to
%    your needs. For example, you can change the path delays or average 
%    path gains.
% # Apply the channel System object to your signal using the step method,
%    which generates random discrete path gains and filters the input
%    signal.
%
% The characteristics of a channel can be shown with the built-in
% visualization support of the System object.

%% Initialization
% The following variables control both the Rayleigh and Rician channel
% objects.  By default, the channel is modeled as four fading paths, each
% representing a cluster of multipath components received at around the
% same delay.
sampleRate500KHz = 500e3;    % Sample rate of 500K Hz
sampleRate20KHz  = 20e3;     % Sample rate of 20K Hz
maxDopplerShift  = 200;      % Maximum Doppler shift of diffuse components (Hz)
delayVector = (0:5:15)*1e-6; % Discrete delays of four-path channel (s)
gainVector  = [0 -3 -6 -9];  % Average path gains (dB)

%%
% The maximum Doppler shift is computed as v*f/c, where v is the mobile
% speed, f is the carrier frequency, and c is the speed of light. For
% example, a maximum Doppler shift of 200 Hz (as above) corresponds to a
% mobile speed of 65 mph (30 m/s) and a carrier frequency of 2 GHz.  
%
% By convention, the delay of the first path is typically set to zero.  For
% subsequent paths, a 1 microsecond delay corresponds to a 300 m difference
% in path length.  In some outdoor multipath environments, reflected paths
% can be up to several kilometers longer than the shortest path. With the
% path delays specified above, the last path is 4.5 km longer than the
% shortest path, and thus arrives 15 microseconds later.
%
% Together, the path delays and path gains specify the channel's average 
% delay profile.  Typically, the average path gains decay exponentially 
% with delay (i.e., the dB values decay linearly), but the specific delay 
% profile depends on the propagation environment.  In the delay profile 
% specified above, we assume a 3 dB decrease in average power for every 5
% microseconds of path delay.
%
% The following variables control the Rician channel System object.  The
% Doppler shift of the specular component is typically smaller than the
% maximum Doppler shift (above) and depends on the mobile's direction of
% travel relative to the direction of the specular component.  The K-factor
% specifies the linear ratio of average received power from the specular
% component relative to that of the associated diffuse components.
KFactor = 10;            % Linear ratio of specular power to diffuse power
specDopplerShift = 100;  % Doppler shift of specular component (Hz)

%% Creating Channel System Objects
% With the parameters specified above, we can now create the
% <matlab:web(fullfile(docroot,'comm','ref','comm.rayleighchannel-class.html'))
% |comm.RayleighChannel|> and
% <matlab:web(fullfile(docroot,'comm','ref','comm.ricianchannel-class.html'))
% |comm.RicianChannel|> System objects. We configure the objects to use
% their self-contained random stream with a specified seed for path gain
% generation.

% Configure a Rayleigh channel object
rayChan = comm.RayleighChannel( ...
    'SampleRate',          sampleRate500KHz, ...
    'PathDelays',          delayVector, ...
    'AveragePathGains',    gainVector, ...
    'MaximumDopplerShift', maxDopplerShift, ...
    'RandomStream',        'mt19937ar with seed', ...
    'Seed',                10, ...
    'PathGainsOutputPort', true);

% Configure a Rician channel object
ricChan = comm.RicianChannel( ...
    'SampleRate',              sampleRate500KHz, ...
    'PathDelays',              delayVector, ...
    'AveragePathGains',        gainVector, ...
    'KFactor',                 KFactor, ...
    'DirectPathDopplerShift',  specDopplerShift, ...
    'MaximumDopplerShift',     maxDopplerShift, ...
    'RandomStream',            'mt19937ar with seed', ...
    'Seed',                    100, ...
    'PathGainsOutputPort',     true);

%% Modulation and Channel Filtering
% Create a
% <matlab:web(fullfile(docroot,'comm','ref','comm.qpskmodulator-class.html'))
% |comm.QPSKModulator|> System object to modulate the channel data, which
% has been generated using the RANDI function. Note that in the code below
% a 'frame' refers to a vector of information bits. A phase offset of pi/4
% is used for this example.
qpskMod = comm.QPSKModulator( ...
    'BitInput',    true, ...
    'PhaseOffset', pi/4);

% Number of bits transmitted per frame is set to be 1000. For QPSK
% modulation, this corresponds to 500 symbols per frame.
bitsPerFrame = 1000;
msg = randi([0 1],bitsPerFrame,1);

% Modulate data for transmission over channel
modSignal = qpskMod(msg);

% Apply Rayleigh or Rician channel object on the modulated data
rayChan(modSignal);
ricChan(modSignal);

%% Visualization
% The fading channel System objects have built-in visualization to show the
% channel impulse response, frequency response, or Doppler spectrum from
% the |step| method.  To invoke it, set the |Visualization| property to its
% desired value before calling the |step| method.  Release the Rayleigh and
% Rician channel System objects now so that we can change their property
% values.

release(rayChan); 
release(ricChan);

%% Wideband or Frequency-Selective Fading
% Setting the |Visualization| property to |'Impulse response'| shows the
% bandlimited impulse response (yellow circles). The visualization also
% shows the delays and magnitudes of the underlying fading path gains (pink
% stembars) clustered around the peak of the impulse response. Note that
% the path gains do not equal the |AveragePathGains| property value because
% the Doppler effect causes the gains to fluctuate over time.
% 
% Similarly, setting the |Visualization| property to |'Frequency response'|
% shows the frequency response (DFT transformation) of the impulses. You
% can also set |Visualization| to |'Impulse and frequency responses'| to
% display both impulse and frequency responses side by side. .
% 
% You can control the percentage of the input samples to be visualized by
% changing the |SamplesToDisplay| property. In general, the smaller the
% percentage, the faster the simulation runs. Once the visualization figure
% opens up, click the |Playback| button and turn off the "Reduce Updates to
% Improve Performance" or "Reduce Plot Rate to Improve Performance" option
% to further improve display accuracy. The option is on by default for
% faster simulation. To see the channel response for every input sample,
% uncheck this option and set |SamplesToDisplay| to |'100%'|.

rayChan.Visualization = 'Impulse and frequency responses';
rayChan.SamplesToDisplay = '100%';

numFrames = 2;

for i = 1:numFrames % Display impulse and frequency responses for 2 frames
    % Create random data
    msg = randi([0 1],bitsPerFrame,1); 
    % Modulate data
    modSignal = qpskMod(msg); 
    % Filter data through channel and show channel responses
    rayChan(modSignal);
end

%%
% As you can see, the channel frequency response is not flat and may have
% deep fades over the 500K Hz bandwidth. Because the power level varies
% over the signal's bandwidth, it is referred to as frequency-selective
% fading.
%
% For the same channel specification, we now display the Doppler spectrum
% for its first discrete path, which is a statistical characterization of
% the fading process.  The System object makes periodic measurements of the
% Doppler spectrum (blue stars).  Over time with more samples processed by
% the System object, the average of this measurement better approximates
% the theoretical Doppler spectrum (yellow curve).

release(rayChan);
rayChan.Visualization = 'Doppler spectrum'; 

numFrames = 5000;

    msg = randi([0 1],bitsPerFrame,1); 
    modSignal = qpskMod(msg); 
    rayChan(modSignal);
end

%% Narrowband or Frequency-Flat Fading
% When the bandwidth is too small for the signal to resolve the individual
% components, the frequency response is approximately flat because of the
% minimal time dispersion caused by the multipath channel. This kind of
% multipath fading is often referred to as narrowband fading, or
% frequency-flat fading.
% 
% We now reduce the signal bandwidth from 500 kb/s (250 ksym/s) to 20 kb/s
% (10 ksym/s), so the channel's delay span (15 microseconds) is much
% smaller than the QPSK symbol period (100 microseconds). The resultant
% impulse response has very small intersymbol interference (ISI) and the
% frequency response is approximately flat.

release(rayChan);  
rayChan.Visualization = 'Impulse and frequency responses';
rayChan.SampleRate = sampleRate20KHz; 
rayChan.SamplesToDisplay = '25%';  % Display one of every four samples

numFrames = 2;

for i = 1:numFrames % Display impulse and frequency responses for 2 frames
    msg = randi([0 1],bitsPerFrame,1);  
    modSignal = qpskMod(msg); 
    rayChan(modSignal); 
end

%%
% To simplify and speed up modeling, narrowband fading channels are
% typically modeled as a single-path fading channel. That is, a multipath
% fading model overspecifies a narrowband fading channel. The following
% settings correspond to a narrowband fading channel. Notice that the shape
% of the bandlimited impulse response is flat.

release(rayChan);  
rayChan.PathDelays = 0;        % Single fading path with zero delay
rayChan.AveragePathGains = 0;  % Average path gain of 1 (0 dB)

for i = 1:numFrames % Display impulse and frequency responses for 2 frames
    msg = randi([0 1],bitsPerFrame,1); 
    modSignal = qpskMod(msg); 
    rayChan(modSignal); 
end

%% 
% The Rician fading channel System object models line-of-sight propagation
% in addition to diffuse multipath scattering.  This results in a smaller
% variation in the magnitude of path gains.  To compare the variation
% between Rayleigh and Rician channels, we make use of a
% <matlab:web(fullfile(docroot,'dsp','ref','dsp.timescope-class.html'))
% |Time Scope|> System object to view their path gains over time.  Note
% that the magnitude fluctuates over approximately a 10 dB range for the
% Rician fading channel (blue curve), compared with 30-40 dB for the
% Rayleigh fading channel (yellow curve). For the Rician fading channel,
% this variation would be further reduced by increasing the K-factor
% (currently set to 10).

%% Fading Channel Impact on Signal Constellation
% We now return to our original four-path Rayleigh fading channel.  We use
% a
% <matlab:web(fullfile(docroot,'comm','ref','comm.constellationdiagram-class.html'))
% |Constellation Diagram|> System object to show the impact of narrowband
% fading on the signal constellation.  To slow down the channel dynamics
% for visualization purposes, we reduce the maximum Doppler shift to 5 Hz.
% Compared with the QPSK channel input signal, you can observe signal
% attenuation and rotation at the channel output, as well as some signal
% distortion due to the small amount of ISI in the received signal.

clear hRicChan hMultipathGain;

rayChan.PathDelays = delayVector;

rayChan.MaximumDopplerShift = 5;

% Configure a Constellation Diagram System object to show received signal

    constDiag(rayChanOut);
end

%% 
% When we increase the signal bandwidth to 500 kb/s (250 ksym/s), we see
% much greater distortion in the signal constellation. This distortion is
% the ISI that comes from time dispersion of the wideband signal. The
% channel's delay span (15 microseconds) is now larger than the QPSK symbol
% period (4 microseconds), so the resultant bandlimited impulse response is
% no longer approximately flat.
